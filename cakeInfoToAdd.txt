If your top layers are mouond-shaped, cut them so they are flat.  (If your layers aren't flat, your filling/frosting will seep off the cake and you'll have a mess.)  Soften gelatin in remaining 1/3 cup of coconut milk. Dissolve over hot water.  Cool completely.  In a bowl, whip the heavy cream.  Fold the gelatin mixture, sugar, and extract into the whipped cream.  Chill frosting until it is of spreading consistency.  MAKE HAUPIA FILLING: In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, salt, cornstarch and water.  set aside.  In a saucepan, heat the coconut milk. When hot, add the sugar mixture.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.  Remove from heat.  Stir in vanilla and cool.  Chill the filling until it is of spreading consistency.  ASSEMBLE THE CAKE: Spread the Haupia Filling between each cake layer (spread it on pretty thickly, about 1/2 inch thick).  You'll have the following layers: cake, filling, cake, filling, cake, filling cake.  Refrigerate assembled cake until set.  Frost entire cake with whipped cream mixture.
